# info-base
This is a project I did to learn SQLite3 and practice Python. It allows the user to input their personal information into a local database, which can later be recalled using a username and password.



The info-base.db file contains 6 stock accounts which can be recalled by default. More accounts can be added to later recall.

Below is the information for the stock accounts:
