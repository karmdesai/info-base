# infoBase

This is the second Python project that I worked on. It allows a user to input their personal information into a local database, which can later be recalled using a username and password. Through this project, I was able to develop and practice my Python skills as well as learn SQLite 3. The 'infoBase.db' file contains 6 sample accounts which can be recalled by default. More accounts can be added to later recall. If you want to view the sample accounts, please look at the 'sampleAccounts.png' file.

**I originally completed this project on November 12, 2018 (when I a beginner). Recently, I changed the style
of the code to match my current programming style.**

### Usage
