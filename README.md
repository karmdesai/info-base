# info-base
This is a project I did to learn SQLite3 and further develop my Python skills. It allows the user to input their personal information into a local database, which can later be recalled.

The info-base.db file contains 6 stock accounts which can be recalled by default. More accounts can be added to later recall.

If you'd like to view the info-base.db file, I recommend using DB Browser for SQLite: https://sqlitebrowser.org/
